	import numpy as np # linear algebra
	import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

	# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
	# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

	''' Returns indices for training set to make a really good set. 
	General strategy:
	    get last 11.5% of data from train in all cases. This is based on num rows in test that
	    do not occur in train. This ensures our training process also doesn't see similar num
	    of rows at the end.

	    For the remainder, grab one row from train for each product_uid that occurs > 1.

	# select only 'id' column, which is a surrogate column name for the rowcount per uid.

	# Only care about uid's with counts higher than 1 (do not remove single rows)
